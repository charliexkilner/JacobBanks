  <p class="bio">Born in Nigeria, Jacob Banks moved to Birmingham in England at the age of 13. Not short of talent, the Brit dabbled in all forms of the creative arts and began singing, playing guitar, and writing songs at the age of 20. A music lover first and foremost, Banks got his start at open mic nights and quickly garnered a following for his commanding vocal presence and daringly intimate songwriting. His music features richly textured beats, with its 808s and synth play, African inspired grooves and a soulful disposition that culminates in an unstoppable new sound. Banks debuted with his EP The Monologue, earning feverish acclaim that saw him supporting artists such as Emeli Sand√©, Sam Smith and Alicia Keys on tour around the U.K. Now, at work on his Interscope Records debut (the follow-up to self-released EP The Paradox), Banks hopes to reenergize soul music for a new generation hoping to be their solace in hard times and a battery pack on a slow Monday morning. </p>
